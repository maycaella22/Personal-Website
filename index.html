                <span> Aspiring CPAs </span>
            </h1>
            <p> Kami ang mga future CPAs, kung saan ang "passing" ay parang unicorn may mga nagsasabi, pero wala pa kami nakikitang totoo.
              It's a race against time, sleep deprivation, and trying to remember kung anong pinasok naming course. Hindi kami sigurado kung magiging CPA kami, pero sigurado kami na magkakaroon kami ng permanenteng dark circles dahil sa "To-Do" list na never matapos.
              So, habang naghihintay kami sa milagro, enjoy na lang namin ang chaos!

                          <p> I'm Narissa Maycaella V. Villeza, a 19-year-old Accountancy student at Imus Institute of Science and Technology. Born on May 22, 2005, I’ve always had a passion for learning, creativity, and a soft spot for cats. I currently have two that bring so much joy to my everyday life.
                            Outside of academics, I enjoy playing The Sims 4, a game that quickly became a favorite of mine thanks to my wonderful boyfriend, Kaycie. He’s not only the one who introduced me to it, but also my biggest supporter who is always there with love, encouragement, and laughter.
                             Thanks for stopping by and getting to know a bit about me! </p>

                          <p> I'm Erlyn Joy Zapra, 20 years old, born on January 4, 2005. I dream of becoming a Certified Public Accountant one day,a goal I’m working hard to achieve. Pink has always been my favorite color; it just makes everything feel a little brighter. Music plays a big part in my life, and I love listening to Taylor Swift, ABBA, and Coldplay. Some of my favorite songs are “Daylight,” “Dancing Queen,” and “The Scientist.” During my free time, you’ll usually find me listening to music, cooking, or catching up on sleep. One series I really enjoyed is When Life Gives You Tangerines it’s not just entertaining, but also packed with real-life lessons that stick with you long after watching. Above all, my favorite Bible verse, Romans 8:28, reminds me that everything happens for a reason: “And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.” It's a constant reminder to trust the process and keep the faith.</p>

                      <p> I’m Sophia L. Soriano.
                        I am currently a student at Imus Institute and proudly taking up Bachelor of Science in Accountancy. Born on April 8, 2005. As someone who values precision, discipline, and growth, I chose this path not only to master the language of business but also to challenge myself intellectually. My journey as an Accountancy student has taught me the importance of patience, consistency, and resilience—qualities that I strive to carry both inside and outside the classroom. I believe in working hard quietly and letting success speak for itself. With every number I solve and every case I analyze, I am one step closer to becoming the future professional I aspire to be. More than academics, I also value personal growth, emotional intelligence, and maintaining balance in all areas of life. I’m continuously learning, evolving, and doing my best to become not just a good student—but a grounded, driven, and compassionate individual.</p>

                      <h2>Hi, I'm Kassandra</h2>
                      <p> My name is Kassandra Laureen S. Cabrera, I’m 20 years old and was born on January 7, 2005. I’m the eldest among four siblings, which has taught me early on the value of responsibility, leadership, and setting a good example.
                        Outside of academics, I have a strong passion for public service and pageantry. I’m currently serving as the Sangguniang Kabataan Chairperson of Barangay Pag-asa 1 in the City of Imus, Cavite, where I actively work on programs for the youth and community. I also love joining pageants and have been fortunate to win several titles, including Miss EAC-C 2023, Binibining DLSU-D 2024, and Campus Queen 2025.
    
                        Balancing academics, leadership, and my love for pageantry has shaped me into a confident, driven, and purpose-filled young woman who’s always striving to grow and make a positive impact.</p>
